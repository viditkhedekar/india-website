	    <p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south
			bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra. It was 
			commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan(reigned 
			from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife,
			Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself.
			The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42 acre) complex, 
			which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal 
			gardens bounded on 3 sides by a crenellated wall. Construction
			of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work
			continued on other phases for the project for another 10 years.
			The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its
			entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around
			32 million rupees, which in 2015 would be approximately 52.8
			billion rupees. The constuction project employed some 20,000
			artisans under the guidence of a board of architects led by
			the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmed Lahauri.
			It attracts 7-8 million visitors every year. Shah Jahan wanted 
			to build a black Taj Mahal so he could be a shadow of his wife 
			but his son didn't let him. Photography is not allowed inside.

	<h3>The Gateway of India</h3>
	<p>The Gateway of India is an arch-monument built in the early
		twentieth century in the city of Mumbai in the Indian state
		of Maharashtra. It was erected to commemorate the landing in
		December 1911 at Apollo Bunder, Mumbai of King-Emperor George 
		V and Queen-Empress Mary, the first British monarch to visit 
		India. At the time of the royal visit, the gateway was not 
		yet built,and a cardboard structure greeted the monarch. 
		The foundation stone was laid in March 1913 for a monument
		built in the Indo-Saracenic style, incorporating elements 
		of 16th century Marathi architecture. The final design of the 
		monument by architect George Wittet was sanctioned only in 1914
		and construction was completed in 1924. The structure is a 
		triumphal arch made of basalt which is 26 meters(85 feet) high.
